# rhd-linking
This is the source code used for my master's thesis '[Record linkage of Norwegian historical census data using machine learning](https://munin.uit.no/handle/10037/28399)' at UiT (2022).

* I admit that this code is not fully well-organized and optimized.
* This code was executed in interactive mode, i.e. cell-by-cell (separated by "#%%")
* For the visualization part, comment on or off as needed to see the results.
