# Errata
Errata for my master's thesis.

#### Abstract   
Since the words 'algorithm' used in the abstract can be confused in meaning by referring to different things 
(the former: ML algorithms such as Logistic regression, Support vector machines, Random forest, XGBoost; 
the latter: the method used for linking, including algorithm, feature set, and match selection parameters), 
I deleted the former and modified the latter as 'method'.

#### Figure 1.1   
Corrected the bar of Finnmark in linking the 1875-1900 censuses.

#### Table 4.1, Figure 4.1   
Since the table and figure in the thesis are the result of 5-folds cross validation for the entire training dataset, 
I corrected with the result of 5-folds cross validation for the split training set. 
(Cross validation was used for performance evaluation, so it does not affect model training.)

#### Tables 4.5-6, 4.9-4.12   
Supplemented tables of full results with precision and recall.
